Additionally, depending on the function, the country and the level of risk implied by their role, certain employees are selected to attend live classroom training as well, including on Anti Bribery & Corruption and Export Control. Attendance in such cases is mandatory, and managers have a responsibility to ensure that their team members do so. Exposed employees are also required to complete regular training refreshers.\n",
    "From 1 October 2021 to 30 September 2022, the Company’s employees followed 290,178 Ethics & Compliance e-learning sessions, including on bribery, corruption and export control. Furthermore, 4,699 employees attended live classroom training on different Ethics & Compliance topics over the period, the majority of which were delivered in virtual classroom settings due to the pandemic.\n",
    "Likewise, the Company also delivered anti-bribery and corruption training towards higher risk third parties, including sales intermediaries, lobbyists and special advisors. In 2022, 100% of higher risk third parties were trained on Ethics & Compliance requirements and expectations.\n",

    "Employees who previously could not be included in Siemens internal IT system for training received in-person training in 2022. Face-to-face training sessions were held at every produc- tion site worldwide. By these means, we ensure that every employ- ee receives training within the recurring three-year cycle, in keeping with the DEGREE target. The new three-year cycle will begin in fiscal 2023 with a new BCG web-based training course for all employees.\n",
