# prompt_engineering_sustainability_reporting

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This project aims to automate the creation of sections for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reports, focusing on the training and business conduct of major corporations. Utilizing OpenAI's language models, the project explores different methods (few-shot and zero-shot learning) and settings (varying temperatures) to generate text that aligns with the Environmental, Social, and Governance Reporting Standards (ESRS).

<h2>Project Structure</h2>

Prompt Engineering: Defines specific prompts for generating reports on companies like BMW, Deutsche Bank, and Hannover RE.
Model Selection: Uses GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 models.
Temperature Settings: Experiments with temperatures of 0.2, 0.8, and 1.2 to gauge the effect on the output.
Learning Techniques: Employs few-shot and zero-shot learning methods.
Output Analysis: Compares and analyzes the generated text to assess effectiveness.
